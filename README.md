#Monty Project

Welcome to the Monty Project! This project, developed by Joseph Thungu and Caleb Cacha, is an interactive command-line interface (CLI) implementation of the Monty language.

Monty is a simple programming language that uses a stack data structure. It has a unique syntax and allows you to perform various operations such as pushing and popping elements from the stack, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and more.

The Monty Project supports executing Monty scripts stored in plain text files. These files typically have a .m or .monty extension. The Monty CLI takes the path to the Monty script as a command-line argument.

The Monty language uses a simple and intuitive syntax. Each line in a Monty script represents a Monty operation. Here are some examples of Monty operations:

push <value>: Pushes an element with the value <value> onto the stack.
pop: Removes the top element from the stack.
add: Adds the top two elements of the stack.
sub: Subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element.
mul: Multiplies the top two elements of the stack.
div: Divides the second top element of the stack by the top element.
mod: Computes the modulo of the second top element of the stack by the top element.
pchar: Prints the ASCII value of the top element of the stack.
pstr: Prints the string starting at the top of the stack.
rotl: Rotates the stack to the top.
rotr: Rotates the stack to the bottom.
swap: Swaps the top two elements of the stack.
For a complete list of Monty operations, please refer to the Monty language documentation..
